# Human Posture and Action Detection using YOLO Model

## Introduction

This project aims to address the challenge of accurately detecting human posture and actions in real-time, with a focus on the usage of a pen with click functionality. While the context of the problem statement mentions a pen, the actual object of interest for this project is an asthma pump, emphasizing the need for precise detection and analysis in healthcare scenarios. This solution utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for efficient and reliable detection of human actions and posture.

## Features

### 1. Real-time Posture and Action Detection

- The YOLO model is employed to detect and analyze human posture and actions in real-time.

### 2. Pen Activation and Deactivation Tracking

- The system tracks and counts the number of times the pen is activated (on) and deactivated (off) within a predefined timeframe, providing accurate data on pen usage.

### 3. Pen Tick Verification

- A feature is implemented to distinguish between correct and incorrect clicks made with the pen, ensuring accuracy in data collection and analysis.

### 4. Thumb vs. Finger Differentiation

- A mechanism is developed to differentiate between pen operations performed using the thumb or other fingers, ensuring precise tracking and analysis.

### 5. Pen-to-Face Distance Measurement

- A reliable method is established to measure the distance between a person's face and the pen during usage, providing insights into ergonomic practices and user behavior.

### 6. Angle at Which Pen is Held

- The technology detects and records the angle at which the pen is held, offering additional insights into user behavior and ergonomic considerations. A 90-degree threshold for angle detection is implemented.

### 7. Shaking Detection

- A feature is integrated to detect shaking movements of the pen before it is used, providing insights into pre-action behaviors and enhancing the accuracy of action detection. This includes count and frequency analysis, orientation detection, and visualization of shake data.

### 8. Guided Tour

- A guided tour feature is implemented to provide users with a step-by-step walkthrough of the system's functionalities, helping them understand how to use the technology effectively. A 90-degree threshold for angle detection is incorporated.

### 9. Privacy and Security

- Robust privacy measures and data security protocols are implemented to protect user information and maintain confidentiality throughout the detection and analysis processes.

## Bonus Features

### 1. Accessibility and Inclusivity

- The solution is designed with considerations for accessibility and inclusivity, ensuring that it can cater to diverse user demographics and needs effectively.

## Usage

- The YOLO model is trained using data collected from pen motions, ensuring accurate detection and analysis of human actions and posture.
- Detailed instructions for deploying and utilizing the solution will be provided in the project documentation.
